# Deploy-a-high-availability-web-app-using-CloudFormation
Iâ€™ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. I will write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. I will begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software.
